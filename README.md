# StackVM Code Generator

A minimal stack-based virtual machine with a code generator, demonstrating how efficient code generation can contribute to SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.

## Overview

This project implements a simple stack-based virtual machine (VM) with a code generator that can convert high-level operations into efficient bytecode. The VM demonstrates how optimized code generation can lead to better performance and resource utilization, contributing to economic growth through more efficient computing.

## Features

- Simple stack-based VM implementation
- Bytecode generator
- Example programs
- Test suite
- Clear documentation

## How it Relates to SDG 8

SDG 8 aims to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth. This project contributes by:
- Demonstrating efficient computing techniques that reduce computational costs
- Providing educational value in compiler and VM design
- Enabling more efficient software that can run on resource-constrained devices
- Potentially reducing energy consumption through optimized code execution

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stackvm-generator.git
cd stackvm-generator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from stackvm import VM, CodeGenerator

# Create a new VM instance
vm = VM()

# Create a code generator
gen = CodeGenerator()

# Generate some bytecode
bytecode = gen.generate([
    ('PUSH', 10),
    ('PUSH', 20),
    ('ADD',),
])

# Run the bytecode
result = vm.execute(bytecode)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```
